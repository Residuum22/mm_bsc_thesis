This bachelor thesis provides insight into the design, operation and potential applications of the new generation of Thread networks. In this thesis, I demonstrate Thread communication between multiple modules and a gateway using the recently released Nordic nRF52840 Dongle modules and my own printed circuit boards. The main advantage of such Thread networks over their competitors is the excellent scalability, mesh topology due to the outstandingly good area coverage and the sufficiently fast data transfer. One of the prominent applications of Thread networks is the smart home(s). In this application area, a large variety of Thread network compatible devices are connected to a large unified mesh network and the sensor/intervention module data generated at the Thread network endpoints can be stored in a unified database, which contributes to the efficient design of control and monitoring systems for smart homes. In my thesis, I build a Thread-based smart-home platform (both from hardware and software point of view) using a central unit (Border Router) and several sensor endpoints (Endpoint). I have also created a graphical user interface to display the data, and to connect and disconnect devices.
